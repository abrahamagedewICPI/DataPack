In many countries, it may be important to add new or missing IMs to the data pack for more accurate IM level target setting this year. The instructions below, give a detailed description of how IMs should be added so the DataPack uses the same IMs as the **FAST**, so that targets are linked to correct budgets. Only Placeholder IMs (Mechanism IDs) from the FAST should be added to DataPack. If you need more Placeholders than are in the FAST reach out to your CL (Country Lead), who can work with Programm Efficiency to update FAST and provide additional IMs. Please, reach out to you SI Advisor and CL if you have additional questions about this process.

1.	Go to “Allocation by SNUxIM” tab
2.	Select the SNU for which you want to add a mechanism
    *	Filter on Column C
3.	Copy any row from the list of mechanisms and “Insert Paste Row”
    *	**_Do this in the middle of the list of mechanisms, not at the beginning or end._**
4.	In the new mechanism row, change the mechanism number and type (DSD or TA)
    *	Columns E and F
    *	Mechanism number is from the **_Mechs List-R_** tab of the **_FAST_**.
    * If you are adding both DSD and TA for a mechanism, this needs to be two separate rows.
5.	In the new mechanism row, delete all the values in columns G through DO.
    * Do not touch the values in columns DP through HX
    *	You will know you have done this if the values in row 5 are 100%.
6.	Reallocate percent targets as needed.
    * Make changes directly in columns DP through HX
    * Make sure your mechanisms add up to 100% (row 5)
7.	Targets will update automatically
    * Columns DP through HX
9.	Go to “IM Summary” tab
10.	Copy any row from the list of mechanisms and “Insert Paste Row” (or "Insert Copied Cells")
    *	Do this in the middle of the list of mechanisms, not at the beginning or end.
11.	In the new mechanism row, change the mechanism agency, number and name
    *	Columns C, D and E
12.	When the new mechanism number is added, the targets will be automatically updated on the "IM Summary" tab
