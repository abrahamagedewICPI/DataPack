### Instructions for adding an IM:

In many countries, it may be important to add new or missing IMs to the data pack for more accurate IM level target setting this year. The instructions below, give a detailed description of how IMs should be added so that they interact appropriately with the linked tabs in the Data Pack and PBAC when targets are transferred. Remember, new IMs added to the data pack in this manner also need to be added in FACTS Info to ensure they are available in DATIM for target entry. This process is not a substitution for the addition and DATIM target entry will not be possible until FACTS Info is updated. Feel free to reach out to you SI Advisor or CL if you have additional questions about this process. 

1.	Go to “Allocation by IM” tab
2.	Select the SNU for which you want to add a mechanism
    *	Filter on Column C
3.	Copy any row from the list of mechanisms and “Insert Paste Row”
    *	Do this in the middle of the list of mechanisms, not at the beginning or end.
4.	In the new mechanism row, change the mechanism number and type (DSD or TA)
    *	Columns E and F
    *	Mechanism number is from FACTS Info
    *	If you are adding both DSD and TA for a mechanism, this needs to be two separate rows.
5.	In the new mechanism row, delete all the values in columns G through X
    *	Do not touch the values in columns Y through AR
    *	You will know you have done this if the values in row 5 are 100%.
6.	Reallocate percent targets as needed.
    *	Make changes directly in columns G through X
    *	Make sure your mechanisms add up to 100% (row 5)
7.	Targets will update automatically
    *	Columns Y through AR
8.	If the mechanism is pre-existing in-country and is already in the list of IMs, the targets will be automatically updated on the “PBAC IM Target” tab
    *	If the mechanism is new, continue to step 9
9.	Go to “PBAC IM Targets” tab
10.	Copy any row from the list of mechanisms and “Insert Paste Row”
    *	Do this in the middle of the list of mechanisms, not at the beginning or end.
11.	In the new mechanism row, change the mechanism agency, number and name
    *	Columns C, D and E
12.	When the new mechanism number is added, the targets will be automatically updated on the “PBAC IM Target” tab
