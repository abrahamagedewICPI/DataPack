### Instructions for adding an IM:

1.	Go to “Allocation by IM” tab
2.	Select the SNU for which you want to add a mechanism
    *	Filter on Column C
3.	Copy any row from the list of mechanisms and “Insert Paste Row”
    *	Do this in the middle of the list of mechanisms, not at the beginning or end.
4.	In the new mechanism row, change the mechanism number and type (DSD or TA)
    *	Columns E and F
    *	Mechanism number is from FACTS Info
    *	If you are adding both DSD and TA for a mechanism, this needs to be two separate rows.
5.	In the new mechanism row, delete all the values in columns G through X
    *	Do not touch the values in columns Y through AR
    *	You will know you have done this if the values in row 5 are 100%.
6.	Reallocate percent targets as needed.
    *	Make changes directly in columns G through X
    *	Make sure your mechanisms add up to 100% (row 5)
7.	Targets will update automatically
    *	Columns Y through AR
8.	If the mechanism is pre-existing in-country and is already in the list of IMs, the targets will be automatically updated on the “PBAC IM Target” tab
    *	If the mechanism is new, continue to step 9
9.	Go to “PBAC IM Targets” tab
10.	Copy any row from the list of mechanisms and “Insert Paste Row”
    *	Do this in the middle of the list of mechanisms, not at the beginning or end.
11.	In the new mechanism row, change the mechanism agency, number and name
    *	Columns C, D and E
12.	When the new mechanism number is added, the targets will be automatically updated on the “PBAC IM Target” tab
