### TO DO

General
- [x] validate data pulls (check (1) [subset data inputs](https://github.com/achafetz/ICPI/blob/master/DataPack/Documents/DP_Indicators.md) and (2)
SNU against final DATIM/Panorama)
- [ ] validate IM and site level data against DATIM/Panorama
- [ ] clustering SNUs --> ask OUs for cluster list?
- [ ] hyperlink all cogs and buttons
- [ ] surround each sub group with a border
- [ ] Regional OUs - adjust PNSU to [Country]/[PSNU]
- [ ] how to clear/gray out Mil row?
- [x] clean VBA script (removing unused public variables)
- [ ] age/sex disaggs --> highlander script???
- [ ] FAQs for clustering, adjusting IM distribution

Data Entry
- [ ] Issue around FY18 Art coverage rate? [Noah - formula you provided matches what's in DP]

HTC Data Entry
- [ ] check peds inclusions in EA
- [ ] include certain SDP for peds only (pediatric clinics and malnutrition)? [Jamie]
- [ ] add other SDPs for countries to use? [Jamie]

Indicator Table
- [ ] change FY16 targets names to FY16 expected(?)
- [ ]  pmtct_eid_yield calculation --> would recommend just pmtct_eid_pos_12mo divided by pmtct_eid [Jamie]
- [ ] Jamie - For PLHIV there is no label for year, does this need to be labelled, or when country teams update their PLHIV numbers does it just overwrite the old ones? Somehow that is what I think happens in the IMPATT dataset

Summary & targets
- [ ] VMMC & TB/HIV logic --> see Jamie's email (re: f/u on the two questions)
- [x] update ovc named range years


## Items to consider changing based on pilot inputs
HTC Data Entry
- [ ] PEPFAR's Coverage of Net New - default = 100% --> change to PEPFAR Tx_Curr/Tx_Curr Sub Nat [Nigeria]

Indicator Table
- [ ] reorder variables for consistency [Moz]
- [ ] FY16 PMTCT_STAT % Pos - PMTCT_STAT_POS/PMTCT_STAT [Denom] --> PMTCT_STAT_POS/PMTCT_STAT [Num] [Nigeria]
- [ ] Add PSNU1 level [Zambia]

Summary & targets
- [x] PP_PREV range used instead of KP_MAT [Moz]
- [ ] Revist FY18 TX_NEW calcuation --> do we need to include retention? [Moz]
- [ ] Inclusion of OVC_HIVSTAT [Zambia]
- [ ] Add PSNU1 level [Zambia]
