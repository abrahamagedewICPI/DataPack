### TO DO

General
- [x] validate data pulls (check (1) [subset data inputs](https://github.com/achafetz/ICPI/blob/master/DataPack/Documents/DP_Indicators.md) and (2)
SNU against final DATIM/Panorama)
- [ ] validate IM and site level data against DATIM/Panorama
- [x] clustering SNUs --> ask OUs for cluster list?
- [ ] hyperlink all cogs and buttons
- [ ] surround each sub group with a border
- [ ] how to clear/gray out Mil row?
- [x] clean VBA script (removing unused public variables)
- [x] age/sex disaggs --> highlander script???
- [ ] FAQs for clustering, adjusting IM distribution, adding in SNU1 (for regional programs, SNU1 = country)

Data Entry
- [x] Issue around FY18 Art coverage rate? [Noah - formula you provided matches what's in DP]

HTC Data Entry
- [ ] check peds inclusions in EA
- [x] include certain SDP for peds only (pediatric clinics and malnutrition)? [Jamie]
- [ ] add other SDPs for countries to use? [Jamie]

Indicator Table
- [x] Jamie - For PLHIV there is no label for year, does this need to be labelled, or when country teams update their PLHIV numbers does it just overwrite the old ones? Somehow that is what I think happens in the IMPATT dataset

Summary & targets
- [x] VMMC & TB/HIV logic --> see Jamie's email (re: f/u on the two questions)

Trends
- [ ] Adjust from quarterly to annual to identify target trajectory?


## Items to consider changing based on pilot inputs

- [ ] FY16 PMTCT_STAT % Pos - PMTCT_STAT_POS/PMTCT_STAT [Denom] --> PMTCT_STAT_POS/PMTCT_STAT [Num] [Nigeria]

Summary & targets
- [x] PP_PREV range used instead of KP_MAT [Moz]
